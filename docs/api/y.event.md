### Y.Event API

**`yevent.target: Y.AbstractType`**\
****    The shared type that this event was created on. This event describes the changes on `target`.

**`yevent.currentTarget: Y.AbstractType`**\
****    The current target of the event as the event traverses through the (deep)observer callbacks. It refers to the type on which the event handler (observe/observeDeep) has been attached. Similar to [Event.currentTarget](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget).

**`yevent.transaction: Y.Transaction`**\
****    The transaction in which this event was created on.

**`yevent.path: Array<String|number>` **\
****    Computes the path from the Y.Doc to the changed type. You can traverse to the changed type by calling `ydoc.get(path[0]).get(path[1]).get(path[2]).get( ..`.

**`yevent.changes.delta: Delta`**\
****    Computes the changes in the array-delta format. See more in the [Delta Format ](delta-format.md)section. The text delta is only available on Y.TextEvent (`ytextEvent.delta`)

**`yevent.changes.keys: Map<string, { action: 'add' | 'update' | 'delete', oldValue: any }>`**\
****    Computes changes on the attributes / key-value map of a shared type. In Y.Map it is used to represent  changed keys. In Y.Xml it is used to describe changes on the XML-attributes.
