You already learned that document updates in Yjs are commutative, associative, and idempotent. Yjs doesn't care in which order document updates are applied, as long as all changes are applied eventually. It is the role of the provider to distribute or store updates generated by the Yjs document. A network provider sync document updates to other peers. A database provider syncs document updates to a database. In this tutorial, you will learn how to build your custom provider for Yjs. The [ Document Updates](../api/document-updates.md) section is a prerequisite for this tutorial.
